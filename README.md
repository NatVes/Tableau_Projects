### 🧠 Skills & Learning Outcomes

During my Data Technician Bootcamp, I built strong skills in **Tableau Desktop** and **Tableau Public**. I learned to work effectively with data, including **preparation**, **filtering**, **grouping**, and applying **Top N logic**. I gained experience creating **line, bar, scatter**, and **pie charts**, as well as designing **interactive dashboards** with **dynamic filters**. Throughout these projects, I focused on turning complex datasets into clear stories and actionable insights, sharpening both my analytical thinking and data visualization skills.
